Yesterday, I went to the park with my friends.
We played soccer for hours and had a picnic under the shade of a big oak tree.
The weather was perfect, with a gentle breeze and clear skies.
After that, we took a long walk around the lake, enjoying the peacefulness of nature. It was a wonderful day filled with laughter and good memories.
