During my summer vacation, I traveled to a beautiful coastal town. The sandy beaches stretched for miles, and the turquoise waters of the ocean were incredibly inviting.
I spent my days swimming, sunbathing, and exploring the local cuisine.
One evening, I watched a stunning sunset over the horizon, and it felt like a moment of pure bliss
